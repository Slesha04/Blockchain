# Blockchain
React Python implementation of blockchain

I am extreamly interested in financial technology and wanted to know more about how block chains work. As a result I decided to go head first and create a blockchain backend with python and a simple front end with node.js. I started the project after watching a tutorial on blockchain. It was an amazing learning experience. Current progress as of Dec 2020 is that half of the back-end is created. I have spent a good few months along side university design this. 

I fist started the project by following a udemy course however i quickly realised that i wanted to customise the application, so I have spent a good amount of time creating the design and architecture of the project.
